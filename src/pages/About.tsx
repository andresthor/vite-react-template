          This project was created by <b>Andrés Sæmundsson</b> as part of a technical assessment for the Frontend Technical Lead position at <b>RavenPack in Marbella</b>.
          <br /><br />
          I've outlined the development steps in the accompanying <code>README.md</code>
          and have used some existing code templates and snippets to work efficiently.
          <br /><br />
          While there’s always room for improvement, I focused on keeping the project
          within roughly six hours of work to align with the scope of the assignment.
          <br /><br />
          I appreciate your time and look forward to discussing any details further if needed.
